# Projectivity Check

This script is part of the project presented in Appendix 9 of the paper [arXiv:2311.15103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15103). Specifically, it checks whether the triangulation constructed in Section 4 is projective. The triangulation is part of the combinatorial data used to construct the MPCP desingularization of the total space in which the Batyrev–Borisov mirror duals to complete intersections of two cubic hypersurfaces in P^5 live.

# Installation

1. Follow the installation guide on the [CYTools](https://cy.tools/docs/getting-started/) official site. 
2. After CYTools is installed, open it. In Jupyter (standard environment for CYTools to work), create a Jupyter notebook with Python 3 (ipykernal) and copy the script from `projectivity_check.ipynb` into the notebook.
3. Run the script using **Shift+Enter**.

Note: CYTools currently runs only under Docker. It is inconvenient — but that's the current setup. After installation, clicking the CYTools icon should open Jupyter by default.
