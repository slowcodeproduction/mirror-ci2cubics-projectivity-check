# Projectivity Check for Triangulations Constructed in arXiv:2311.15103 

This script is part of the project presented in Appendix 9 of the paper [arXiv:2311.15103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15103). Specifically, it checks whether the triangulation constructed in Section 4 is projective.

# Install

1. Follow installation guide on [CYTools](https://cy.tools/docs/getting-started/) official site. 
2. After CYTools is installed, open it. In the Jupyter (standard envelope for CYTools to work), create Jupyter notebook with Python 3 (ipykernal) and copy the script from "projectivity_check.ipynb" to Jupyter notebook.
3. Run the script using Shift+Enter.

Note: CYTools currently runs only under Docker, which may be inconvenient â€” but that's the current setup. After installation, clicking the CYTools icon should open Jupyter by default.
